ActiveCore is a temporary working name for MLIP-enabled framework prototype and may change in the future.

At the moment, GPLC component is distributed as open-source, while rtl and pipe MLIPs are distributed as static compiled libraries to demonstrate MLIP protection capabilities.

MLIP components are located at /mlip.
Test designs are located at /designs. MLIP-based components are located at activecore, RTL sources are located at rtl.
MLIP code for DLX processor is located at activecore/dlx_mem1cycle. dlx_memsplit implementation is currently under development.
Test project for DLX processor is located at rtl/dlx_udm. The projects need preliminary build of DLX core using the framework.
